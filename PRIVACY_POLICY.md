# Privacy Policy for YouTidy

**Last Updated:** January 3, 2026

## Overview

YouTidy is a browser extension that enhances your YouTube viewing experience by hiding unwanted controls, locking view modes, and blocking distracting hotkeys. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains how the extension handles your data.

## Data Collection

**YouTidy does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

The extension:
- Does **not** collect any personal information

- Does **not** access your YouTube account information
- Does **not** transmit any data to external servers

## Data Storage

YouTidy stores only your extension preferences (settings) using Chrome's built-in `chrome.storage.sync` API. This data:
